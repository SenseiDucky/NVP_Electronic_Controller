# NVP Electronic Controller

An extremely-configurable, ready-to-manufacture electronic controller for use in low-cost CPAP ventilators. This design adheres to the specifications laid out in the National Ventilator Project (NVP) Call for Proposals of 4 April 2020.


Inside this repository are the following resources:

- Printed circuit boards (PCB) designs, provided both as Gerber files and an Eagle project
- Bill of Materials
- Firmware for an 8-bit Microchip microcontroller


This design is free for anyone to use without restriction or acknowledgement. The authors request that any additional design work on the basis of this controller is open-sourced as well.


## Core Features

- Gas supply on/off push-buttons
- Push-button input of desired inspired oxygen proportion (FiO2)
- Push-button input of desired continuous airway pressure
- LED feedback of actual airway pressure
- Electrical control of inspired oxygen proportion actuator
- Electrical control of airway pressure actuator
- Powered by consumer-grade USB power bank or cell-phone charger
