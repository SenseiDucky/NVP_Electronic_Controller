# NVP Electronic Controller

A highly-configurable, ready-to-manufacture electronic controller for use in low-cost CPAP ventilators. This design adheres to the specifications laid out in the National Ventilator Project (NVP) Call for Proposals of 4 April 2020. The authors are not affiliated with the NVP.


Inside this repository are the following resources:

- Printed circuit boards (PCB) designs, provided both as Gerber files and an Eagle project
- Bill of Materials
- Firmware for an 8-bit Microchip microcontroller


This design is free for anyone to use without restriction or acknowledgement. The authors request that any additional design work on the basis of this controller is open-sourced as well.


## Core Features

- Gas supply on/off push-buttons
- Push-button input of desired inspired oxygen proportion (FiO<sub>2</sub>)
- Push-button input of desired continuous airway pressure
- LED feedback of actual airway pressure
- Electrical control of inspired oxygen proportion actuator
- Electrical control of airway pressure actuator
- Powered by consumer-grade USB power bank or cell-phone charger

# Sub-system overview



## Microcontroller



## LED feedback

LED arrays provide feedback for the following metrics:

1. Desired inspired oxygen proportion (FiO<sub>2</sub>)
2. Desired airway pressure
3. Current airway pressure
4. Oxygen supply pressure *(optional)*
5. Compressed air supply pressure *(optional)*


LEDs are arranged in vertical rows, placed within clearly-deliniated labelled sections. Each LED is laballed with its discrete value. This eliminates the need for any seperate labelling or faceplate.

Provision is made on the PCB for either 5mm through-hole, 3mm through-hole or 0603 (1608 metric) surface-mount LEDs.


### 1. Desired inspired oxygen propoprtion

The NVS specification calls for inspired oxygen proportion (FiO<sub>2</sub>) to be set in increments of 10% over a range of 30% to 100%. An array of 8 LEDs are installed for this purpose.

Feedback for actual current FiO<sub>2</sub> is not considered.


### 2. Desired airway pressure

The NVS specification calls for airway pressure to be set within a range of 5 to 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Arbitrary intervals of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 results in 5 LEDs.

### 3. Actual current airway pressure

The NVS specification calls for airway pressure to be set within a range of 5 to 25 cmH<sub>2</sub>O, and for a maximum over-pressure of 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>0. A pressure monitoring range of 0 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 to 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>0 is considered. A 9-LED array provides feedback in increments of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>0.


### 4. Oxygen supply pressure *(optional)*

Allowance is made for the monitoring of oxygen supply pressure. A scale is not prescribed and is firmware-dependent.

### 5. Compressed air supply pressure *(optional)*

Allowance is made for the monitoring of compressed air supply pressure. A scale is not prescribed and is firmware-dependent.


## Power

Input power is provided by a USB power bank or cell-phone charger. Most end users are expected to have at least one of these consumer-grade devices already in their possession, and failing this, they are cheaply and easily sourced elsewhere.


A consumer-grade USB supply eliminates the need for on-board AC/DC conversion or 5V voltage regulation. Two configurations are possible:

1. USB charger only
2. USB charger, connected to USB power bank

A back-up power period of 30 minutes or more is given by the NVS requirement specification, and therefore the second power configuration is recommended. Power use of the controller will depend on the exact configuration. The product of the 0.5 hour requirement and typical controller current draw (for a given configuration) will provide the battery bank cappacity requirement.




# Adherence to NVS requirements

## NVS external interface requirements


| Interface | ID | Requirement  | Applicability |
| --------- | -- | ------------ | ------------- |
| I.1: Oxygen supply | R.I.1 | All gas connectors and hoses must use standard non-interchangeable connectors and be colour coded according to recognised medical standards. | Not applicable to controller |
| I.1: Oxygen supply | R.I.2 | The NVS Oxygen inlet shall connect to standard South African hospital wall Oxygen supply or Oxygen bottle interfaces. | |
| I.1: Oxygen supply | R.I.3 | The NVS shall regulate the supplied Oxygen pressure as needed to operate
effectively. |

| I.4: Exhalent | R.I.4 | All parts coming into contact with the patientâ€™s breath must be either disposable or able to be decontaminated between patients. | |
| I.4: Exhalent | R.I.5 | The exhaled gas shall be filtered with an easily replaceable HMEF viral filter. | |
| I.5: Patient physical interface and gas supply | R.I.6 | The mask or hood shall have a sealing mechanism to prevent the escape of exhaled air and fluids (to prevent contamination) | |
| I.5: Patient physical interface and gas supply | R.I.7 | The hood/mask and all gas supply pipes shall be made from medically approved materials. | |
| I.5: Patient physical interface and gas supply | R.I.8 | The device shall be usable with the patient in seated or lying down positions. | |
| I.5: Patient physical interface and gas supply | R.I.9 | The hood/mask shall have an anti-asphyxiation mechanism to allow for additional ambient air to enter the mask in case the inhalation gas volume exceeds the gas supply volume. | |

| I.7 | Power R.I.10 | The NVS shall connect to standard 240V, 50 Hz South African wall power socket. Only required if power interface is used. | |
| I.7 | Power R.I.11 | If the NVS function is dependent on electrical power, it shall automatically provide backup power for a period of 30 minutes or longer in case the main power supply fails. | |
| I.7 Compressed air | R.I.12 | The NVS compressed air inlet shall connect to a standard South African hospital wall compressed air supply point. Only required if compressed air interface is used. | |
